			<p class="text">Raphael can finally retire from being the thief we all know. Now, he can focus on finding out more about his father. But. A month later, Raphael reads a newspaper article about an art theft... that wasn't his. The police seem to think it was though. Phantom R needs to clear his name and get to the bottom of this! </p>
